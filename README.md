# Business Site
Mob programming (five people)
A mock business site with a header with a responsive image
A signup form with text fields, a set of checkboxes, and a submit button. 
An FAQ accordion, built with JavaScript

## The problem

The group made a sketch in Figma. The groups then took turns being the code pilot. The other group members discussed and search the Internet and looked at the group members' previous projects for information and then instructed the code pilot on what to write. If we had more time we would have added a navbar to the page and some more pictures and information about the mock business. We could also have structured our CSS and reduced it according to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and added CSS variables e.g. the colors and fonts.
